Unauthorized access to this page can lead to severe security risks, including site defacement, data breaches, and complete takeover of the website.
Recommendations:
1. Use Strong Authentication:
Ensure strong, unique passwords are used for all administrative accounts.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

2. Limit Access by IP:
Restrict access to the wp-admin page by allowing only trusted IP addresses.

3.Implement Security Plugins:
Use security plugins like Wordfence or Sucuri to enhance the protection of your WordPress site and monitor for unauthorized access attempts.

4. Rename Login URL:
Use plugins or custom configurations to change the default login URL from /wp-admin to something less predictable.
